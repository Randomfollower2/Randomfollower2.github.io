	  Absurdist Reddit Bot
  </h1>
</header>

<section>

	<p> For this project, I didn't support a specific candidate. Instead, I wanted to create an Reddit bot that undermines <strong> the currrent administration </strong> through absurdist (fake) claims. The claims are generally about Donald Trump, Mike Pence, the Republican Party, and other characters in the current administration.

	<p> In the example below, my bot gives a scathing reply to another bot that was supporting Donald Trump. My appreciation of this thread directly corresponds with its stupidity...

	<p> In this second example, my bot supplies a top comment to a different submission. He is lonely... but it is nonetheless a good example of the "aburdism" I am shooting for!

	<h2> SCORE </h2>

	<p> I deserve a <strong> ~~~ 95 ~~~ </strong> on this project. I completed all the tasks asked of me, and further, I included an up_vote function that up-votes all comments that mention Yang!
